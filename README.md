Tutorial: Information supply and demand for veterinarians and other One health professionals
Biological surveillance and infodemiology during crisis in (almost) real time. During a disaster, timely and accurate information is crucial. Listening to social media (new media in general) and traditional media is known as an OSINT tool and has been adopted by WHO and CDC in solving public health problems.
Learning objectives:
Understand the capabilities and limitations of infoveillence/infodemiology approaches
Use of simple, free and commercial new/social/traditional media monitors (OSINT)
Acquire the ability to listen to the Internet in near real time to support One Health epidemiological surveillance
Understanding the effectiveness of using pseudosyndromic surveillance on the Internet
Infovaillence deals with the analysis of Internet content in order to predict or understand medical phenomena. Its most important advantage is the possibility of early warning (e.g. participatory epidemiology) or forecasting, or the correctness of incidence and prevalence estimates or compliance with recommendations. Transferring syndromic supervision to the Internet (estimation of the scale of health problems, early warning of events) was of great importance. However, due to the failure of the "Google Flu" project and many other issues such as geolocation, social media infosurveillance has not been largely integrated with epidemiological surveillance systems. Media monitoring may answer the question whether we can draw conclusions about managing a health crisis from Internet analysis and whether we can estimate the prevalence of diseases faster and better than from traditional epidemiological surveillance? I.e. listening to social media in real time supported the hypothesis about the biological cause of the Oder disaster in August 2022.

Case Study Millennial flood Thessaly (Greece)
The study focuses on the impact of disasters, specifically floods, on farm and companion animals, drawing on the summer 2023 flood in Thessaly, Greece, as a case study. It highlights the significant challenges and dangers these animals face during such events, influenced by various factors like flood severity, owner preparedness, and availability of rescue efforts. The paper underscores the insufficient coverage of veterinary-related issues in existing crisis management plans, emphasizing the need for comprehensive emergency response planning for animal care and welfare.
Veterinary and One health crisis response
Animals can be affected indirectly through (i) Displacements: Floodwaters can force animals to leave their habitats, resulting in displacement. Farm animals, such as cattle and horses, may roam aimlessly in search of higher ground, often getting separated from their owners; (ii) Injury and illness: Floodwaters can carry debris and contaminants that pose health risks to animals. Injuries can also occur as animals attempt to navigate the floodwaters, especially if they encounter sharp objects or fast-moving currents; (iii) Disease spread: The close quarters in evacuation centers or temporary shelters can facilitate the spread of diseases among animals. Contaminated floodwaters can also introduce pathogens into farm animal environments; iv) Loss of shelter: Farm animals often rely on structures like barns and coops for shelter. Zoo animals may escape. Flooding can destroy these structures, leaving animals exposed to the element.
Collecting Information from Google Trends During Disasters or disease outbreaks
Introduction
Google Trends can be a valuable tool to understand public interest, concerns, and information-seeking behavior related to the disaster or disease. It allows you to understand what information is demanded of the general population. As animal health is usually of minor interest only part of veterinary public health issues can be found here. This tutorial will guide you through the process of collecting data from Google Trends during a disaster event.
Step 1: Access Google Trends
Go to Google Trends.
No account is needed, but signing in with a Google account may provide additional features.
Step 2: Enter Search Terms
In the search box, enter keywords related to the disaster (e.g., "hurricane name", "flood in [location]", "earthquake", “[disease name] outbreak”).
You can search for directly used queries (how people form queries in their language) or by topic (AI-aggregated queries by Google to avoid flexions or using synonyms)
Press Enter or click the search icon.
Step 3: Refine Your Search
Once you see the trend data for your search term, use the filters to refine the data.
You can filter by:
Location: Focus on the affected area Country (i.e. Poland) or Country region (Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship).
Time: Choose the duration. For ongoing disasters, “Past 4 hours”, “Past day”, “7 days”  for more immediate data.
Categories: To narrow down to relevant contexts as general is default (e.g. "Health" if we are interested in the impact of flood on health ).
Search type: Web search (default), News search, YouTube search, etc., depending on where you expect to find the most relevant data.
Step 4: Analyze the Trends
Look for spikes in search volume, which indicate increased public interest or concern.
Observe related topics and queries to understand specific concerns or information needs.
Compare intensity of interest in subregions of selected region (on maps)
take screenshots for a visual record. Alternatively clicking on the “Download” button in the top right corner of the trend chart. Saved csv can be used for plots as here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjkgqYJqeXqooD__WIWzXGmTfDmfftsIy4WQfZkY6_4/edit#gid=1660395897 
Step 6: Compare Data
For a broader perspective, compare the disaster-related trends with other terms or previous disasters.
Please be aware that RSV 100 will be reference being maximum of maximum among all series in for all given time points
Use the "Compare" tool in Google Trends to add another search term or regions.
Step 7: Continuous Monitoring
For ongoing disasters, regularly update your search because people are tending to change their searching behaviour (i.e. different names of concepts with time) to get the latest data.
Step 8: Contextualize and Interpret Data
Remember that Google Trends shows relative popularity, not absolute search volume.
Cross-reference with news updates, social media, and other sources for a comprehensive understanding.
Step 9: Reporting and Application
Use the insights for reporting, decision-making, or directing aid and resources.
Be mindful of privacy and ethical considerations when sharing or using data.
Conclusion
Google Trends is a powerful tool for gauging public interest and concerns during disasters. By following these steps, you can effectively collect and analyze data to aid in understanding and responding to the situation.
Additional Tips
Stay flexible with your search terms, as public focus can shift rapidly during a disaster.
Use insights responsibly and consider the limitations of the data.
Explore Google Trends’ related features like "Interest by subregion" for more granular insights.


Tutorial: How to Collect Information from Media Monitoring Tool (i.e. Brand24) During a Disaster
Introduction
In times of disaster, timely and accurate information is crucial. Media monitoring tools offer a way to collect and analyze data from various media sources. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using these tools effectively during a disaster.
Step 1: Choose the Right Media Monitoring Tools
Define Your Needs: Identify what kind of information you need (e.g., news about the disaster, public sentiment, emergency announcements).
Select Tools: Choose tools that best fit your needs. Options include  SentiOne, Brand24, Publicon, Sentimenti, or Sotrender, Buzzano, EventRegistry, and specialized disaster monitoring software.
Step 2: Set Up Alerts and Keywords
Identify Keywords: Choose keywords related to the disaster (e.g. the name of the disaster, disease, affected animals, affected areas, types of assistance).
Be aware that some names can have multiple meanings and some filtering is needed
Step 3: Monitor Social Media Channels
Focus on Relevant Platforms: Different disasters may have more activity on specific platforms (e.g., Twitter for real-time updates, Facebook for community support).
Use Hashtags: Monitor relevant hashtags related to the disaster for more specific information.
Step 4: Analyze News Outlets and Blogs (i.e. topic modelling and sentiment analysis)
Broaden Your Scope: Include national and local news websites, as well as relevant blogs and online forums.
Set Up RSS Feeds (i.e. offered by Google): Use RSS feed aggregators to keep track of updates from multiple websites (see news search by google).
Use sentiment analysis to measure emotional load (in our example look at the figure presenting share of negative mentions with a peak in outbreak phase of disease)
Topic modelling can be performed (in our example The first most important topic of discussion was i) Government Incompetence followed by ii) Extreme Weather Impact; iii) Flood Relief Payments; iv) Greek Crisis Response; v) Farmers Protest; vi) Infrastructure Safety; vii) Flood Aid Platform; viii) Flood Damage Reports; ix) Climate Crisis Impact)
Step 5: Utilize Geographic Information
Map Data: Use tools like Google Earth or GIS software to visualize the impact area (some paid offer it
Localize Information: Tailor your monitoring to focus on news and updates from the specific regions affected.
Step 6: Understand  Community structure
Interactive Monitoring: Engage with social media posts or news articles to gather more in-depth information.
Use Social Network Analysis (i.e. retweeting networks) to see how discourse is fragmented
Community Forums: Participate in online forums or community groups related to the disaster for firsthand accounts and local updates.
Step 7: Data Analysis
Organize Data: Keep track of collected data in an organized manner (e.g., spreadsheets, databases).
In our spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjkgqYJqeXqooD__WIWzXGmTfDmfftsIy4WQfZkY6_4/edit#gid=1660395897 we can read mentions, see the original source (for analysis of photos of videos such as footage from disaster), see calculated sentiment for a mention, source platform, of if social media user disseminating the information
Identify Patterns: Look for patterns or trends in the data that can inform response strategies.
Step 8: Stay Updated and Adapt
Regular Reviews: Regularly review and adjust your monitoring strategy to adapt to the evolving nature of the disaster.
Feedback Loop: Use insights gained to improve real-time response and planning.
Conclusion
Effective media monitoring during a disaster can provide invaluable insights for response teams and affected communities.
